## Disclaimer

**Data Sources**: This project utilizes synthesized EEG and brain connectivity data based on realistic neuroscience principles. The EEG patterns are generated using established signal processing models that incorporate alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz) brain wave components with realistic noise characteristics. Brain connectivity matrices follow known anatomical constraints and functional network organization principles derived from neuroimaging research. Additional reference data sources include depersonalized recordings from McGill University Health Center (MUHC) and Jewish General Hospital, used under strict confidentiality protocols for validation of signal characteristics only. All implementations are for educational and research purposes, demonstrating quantum algorithmic concepts rather than providing clinical diagnostic tools.

## Objective

This repository implements quantum algorithms for neuroscience applications, specifically targeting brain network analysis and EEG pattern recognition. The project demonstrates how quantum computing can provide computational advantages for neural signal processing through two primary approaches: exact pattern search using Grover's algorithm and adaptive classification using variational quantum circuits.

The core challenge in computational neuroscience is efficiently processing high-dimensional neural data where classical algorithms face exponential scaling problems. For a brain network with $N$ neurons, the number of possible connectivity patterns grows as $2^{NÂ²}$, while the neural state space scales as $2^N$. Quantum algorithms can potentially overcome these limitations through:

**Grover's Search Algorithm** for exact neural pattern detection:
$$|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = (G)^{\\sqrt{N}/4} |s\\rangle$$

where $G = -U_s U_f$ represents the Grover operator combining the oracle $U_f$ and diffusion operator $U_s$.

**Variational Quantum Circuits** for adaptive brain state classification:
$$\\langle \\hat{H} \\rangle_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\langle \\psi_{data} | U^{\\dagger}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\hat{H} U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) | \\psi_{data} \\rangle$$

where $U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is a parametrized quantum circuit optimized to minimize classification cost functions.

**Goal:** Demonstrate quantum computational advantages for neural pattern recognition, implement scalable quantum algorithms for brain network analysis, and establish frameworks for quantum-enhanced neuroscience applications compatible with near-term quantum hardware.

## Theoretical Background

### Neural Dynamics and Quantum Encoding

Biological neural networks exhibit complex dynamics that can be mathematically modeled and encoded into quantum states. The Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model captures essential neural behavior:

$$\\tau \\frac{dV}{dt} = -V(t) + I(t)$$

where $V(t)$ represents membrane potential, $\\tau$ is the membrane time constant, and $I(t)$ represents synaptic input. For network analysis, we extend this to coupled systems:

$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{V}}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{s}(t) + \\mathbf{I}_{ext}(t)$$

The quantum analog, the Quantum Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (QLIF) model, represents neural excitation through qubit state probabilities:

$$\\alpha[t+1] = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{(\\theta + \\varphi[t])X[t+1] + (\\gamma[t] + \\varphi[t])(1-X[t+1])}{2}\\right)$$

where $\\alpha[t]$ is the excited state probability, $\\theta$ is the spike rotation angle, and $\\gamma[t]$ models quantum decoherence.

### EEG Signal Processing and Quantum Encoding

EEG signals require preprocessing before quantum algorithm implementation. Three primary encoding strategies convert continuous neural signals to quantum-compatible states:

**Threshold Encoding**: Binary state preparation based on statistical thresholding
$$b[n] = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } |x[n]| > \\theta_{factor} \\cdot \\sigma(x) \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$

**Phase Encoding**: Captures oscillatory dynamics through Hilbert transform
$$\\phi[n] = \\arg(\\mathcal{H}(x[n]))$$

**Amplitude Encoding**: Preserves magnitude relationships
$$a[n] = \\frac{x[n] - x_{\\min}}{x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}}$$

### Information Theory in Neural Systems

Neural pattern complexity is quantified using Shannon entropy for discrete spike patterns:
$$H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \\log_2 p(x_i)$$

For practical EEG analysis, we implement Normalized Corrected Shannon Entropy (NCSE):
$$NCSE(L,\\Psi) = \\frac{CSE(L,\\Psi)}{CSE_{max}(L,\\Psi)}$$

where $L$ represents word length and $\\Psi$ is the symbolic sequence derived from EEG data.

## Caveats

- **Hardware Limitations**: Current implementations use classical simulation of quantum algorithms. Real quantum devices would face decoherence, gate errors, and measurement noise that could degrade performance.

- **Feature Space Constraints**: The 4-qubit demonstrations limit feature dimensionality. Clinical EEG analysis requires much higher-dimensional feature spaces that challenge current quantum hardware capabilities.

- **Training Data Requirements**: Variational quantum classifiers require extensive training data to achieve good generalization. Real neural data exhibits high variability that may challenge quantum learning algorithms.

- **Encoding Efficiency**: Converting continuous EEG signals to discrete quantum states necessarily loses information. Optimal encoding strategies remain an open research question.

- **Scalability Challenges**: While quantum algorithms show theoretical advantages, practical implementation for large brain networks requires error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

- **Clinical Validation**: The synthesized data used for demonstration lacks the complexity and artifacts present in real clinical EEG recordings.
